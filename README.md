Domain: Car Rental

Problem: Car Rental Solution, I noticed there seems to be a problem with manual rental application as it is harder to manage rentals when they are done through manual forms or paper-based systems.

Solution: My aim is to create a simple Car Rental solution that will allow small rental companies to use this system to capture rentals. This would make rentals a much quicker and easier process. It would also save the client and the business lots of time.
